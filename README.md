# make-macos-sane
A series of steps and/or scripts to modify MacOS into a usable OS for someone coming from Windows.

## Steps:

1. Remove all the Apple Programs from the taskbar
2. Go to Keyboard > Settings and change `Command` > `Control`, `Control` > `Command`, and `Global` to `Command`. Repeat for any external keyboards.
3. Go to Trackpad > Settings and enable `Tap to click`
4. Use Safari to download a better browser then close it and never open it again
5. [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) so that you can install the other stuff you need
6. [Install middleclick-sonoma](https://github.com/artginzburg/MiddleClick-Sonoma) so that the trackpad supports three finger middleclick like it's 2012
7. [Install rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) so that windows can be snapped to the side like it's 2015
8. [Install kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/binary/#binary-install) so that your terminal is GPU rendered like it's 2019
9. Open Finder, right click `desktop` > `add to dock`, then right click the dock icon and change `View content as` to `Fan` and `Sort by` to `Date Modified` so that you have access to screenshots
